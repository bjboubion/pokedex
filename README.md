# Pokedex

This is a pokedex that was built using ReactJS. This is the perfect project for a complete front-end app, as the pokedex relies entirely on a well built UI and fetching a pokemon API. As this is a recent project, I have only implemented the first 151 pokemon, but as I continue working on this project, I will implement new features and new pokemon. Stay tuned!

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped by create-react-app and runs react-scripts. These instructions provide you a way to install a pokedex on your local machine as well as scripts to test and build the project for deployment

Start:

```
npm start
