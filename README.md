# Pokedex

This is a pokedex that was built using ReactJS. This is the perfect project for a complete front-end app, as the pokedex relies entirely on a well built UI and fetching a pokemon API. As this is a recent project, I have only implemented the first 151 pokemon, but as I continue working on this project, I will implement new features and new pokemon. Stay tuned!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Start

```
npm start

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
